            is subject to the terms and conditions in this Terms of Use (this “ToU”). You must agree to this ToU in order to
            use the Service. If you use the Service, or click to accept or agree to this ToU if presented to you in a user
            interface for the Service, we will understand this as your acceptance of this ToU and your agreement to all of
            its terms and conditions. By accepting this ToU or using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have
            the legal capacity to enter a contract in the jurisdiction where you reside. If you do not accept this ToU,

            manager to verify such information. If you are a landlord or property manager, you acknowledge and agree that
            you have read the “Notice to Furnishers of Information” at the end of this ToU. If you are using the Service on
            behalf of your employer or another entity (“Organization”), you represent and warrant that you have full legal
            authority to bind your Organization to this ToU. Accordingly, all references in this ToU to “you” or “your”

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2>2. Subscription</h2>
        <p>Your RentReporters subscription will continue and automatically renew until terminated. To use the Denari
            service you must provide us with a Payment Method. “Payment Method” means a current, valid, accepted method of
            payment, as may be updated from time to time. You must cancel your membership before it renews in order to
            avoid billing to your Payment Method of the subscription fees for the next billing cycle (see “5.6 Cancellation
            By You” below). Denari offers Monthly and Annual subscriptions. The Monthly subscription has an initial and
            recurring payment charge each month. The subscription will be created, and the initial charge posted, on the
            day that your initial rent history is ready to be reported to a credit bureau, and the subscription will
            auto-renew every month on that date going forward. The Annual subscription covers a period of 12 months, will
            be created and charged on the day you sign up for service, and will auto-renew on the anniversary each year.

            any time without notifying you in advance.</p>

            time, without notifying you in advance, for any reason or no reason, including, without limitation, for any
            violation of this ToU or if Denari suspects that you have used any aspect of the Service to conduct any
            fraudulent or illegal activity. If Denari disables your access to your account, you may be prevented from
            accessing the Service, your account details or any materials contained in your account. If Denari terminates
            your service for what it believes to be fraudulent activity, you shall not receive a refund of fees paid to
            Denari.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2>5. Accounts and Security</h2>
        <h3>5.1. Account</h3>
        <p>To access certain features of the Service, you must have an account. You may only register for an account if you
            are eighteen or older and have a valid U.S. Social Security Number. By registering, you certify that you meet
            these criteria. You may be required to provide information about yourself as part of the registration process
            or your continued use of the Service. All information you provide to us must be true, accurate, current, and
            complete information. You are required to keep all information up to date and accurate. You agree not to
            misrepresent your identity, your personal information, or other information you provide to us.</p>

        <h3>5.2. Fees</h3>
        <p>You agree to pay all applicable fees and taxes incurred by you or anyone using your account. Unless otherwise
            noted, all currency references are in U.S. dollars. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment
            terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes payable. Denari may, from time to time, modify, amend,
            or supplement its pricing and billing procedures, and such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting
            a link to an update of this ToU or posting such changes elsewhere on the Site. You understand that Denari may
            report your rent history to one or more credit bureaus, however, Denari does not offer any guarantee that it
            will report to any credit bureau in the future. Should Denari initiate reporting with a bureau that it did not
            previously report to, there shall be no additional charge to you for reporting your rent history or ongoing
            rent payments to such bureau. If there is a dispute regarding your payment of fees, or the Service, Denari
            shall have the right to terminate your account without prior notice. For the avoidance of doubt, if you
            purchase a monthly (or other periodic) membership, you agree and acknowledge that your subscription has an
            initial and recurring payment charge each month beginning on the date that your initial rent history is to
            ready to be reported to a credit bureau at the then-current subscription rate, and you accept responsibility
            for all recurring charges prior to cancellation, including where applicable any charges processed by Denari
            after the expiration date of your payment card. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY APPLICABLE FEES AND OTHER
            CHARGES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART EXCEPT AS FOUND IN OUR REFUND POLICY. YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR
            ALL CHARGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES.</p>

        <h3>5.3. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>No refunds shall be provided except as provided in this paragraph. Once your rental history has been reported to
            a credit bureau and your credit score has been updated you are eligible for a refund. Once reported, if you are
            unsatisfied with the effect the reporting of your rental history has on your credit you may request a refund.
            Such a request must be made within 7 days from the time your rental history was reported. If the 7 days falls
            outside a business day then such a request must be made the next business day. There are no exceptions to this
            policy, for example you understand that this policy applies even if your rent was not reported to a credit
            bureau if such failure was not the fault of RentReporters including such instances where you failed to provide
            documents requested to verify your identity, providing false documents, or for the failure of your landlord to
            cooperate in your rent verification or in establishing their identity. In addition, the credit bureaus do not
            allow reporting of commercial properties. If you attempt to report a commercial property, a refund will not be
            issued. For security purposes, any request made under this paragraph must be made by telephone using the
            customer service number listed at https://denarisolutions.com.</p>

        <p>5.4. Account Security Maintaining account security is very important. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
            of your account password. You agree to notify Denari immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of
            your password or of your account.</p>

        <p>5.5. Account Sharing or Transfers You may not register an account for anyone but yourself. Accounts may not be sold, traded, gifted, or otherwise
            transferred at any time under any circumstances. You may not share your account with, or disclose your password
            to, anyone else.</p>

        <p>5.6. Cancellation by You You have the right to cancel your subscription or your account at any time. You may cancel either your
            subscription or your account using one of the methods below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email Support@denarisolutions.com with the subject line “Cancel My Account”. To help us better understand
                our tenants and their experience, please include the reason for you cancellation in the body of the email,
                although this is not required.</li>
            <li>Contact us via Live Chat through the “Contact Us” tab at https://denarisolutions.com.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you cancel a subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription
            term.</p>

        <p>5.7. Termination by Denari Denari may at any time terminate your account if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Denari determines that you are (i) in breach of or otherwise acting inconsistently with this ToU or (ii)
                engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities or other conduct that may result in liability to Denari;</li>
            <li>Denari determines it is required by law to terminate your account; or</li>
            <li>Denari decides to stop providing the Service or critical portions of the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>5.8. Effect of Account Termination or Cancellation If you voluntarily terminate your account or allow your account to lapse, you may reactivate that account at any
            time by logging in to the Service through the Site and reactivating the account. There may be a fee associated
            with such reactivation. Accounts terminated by Denari for any type of abuse including, without limitation, a
            violation of this ToU, may not be reactivated for any reason.</p>

        <p>5.9. Reporting Through Lease Term Notwithstanding any other provision of this ToU, Denari at its sole discretion shall have the right but not the
            obligation to continue to verify the date of monthly rent payments through the remainder of the current lease
            term and report such payment history to one or more of the national credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax, and
            Experian).</p>

The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”) and under the terms set forth in this ToU. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 20 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 20 will control and prevail. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 20.4, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and Denari will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this ToU, (a) you and Denari may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (b) the arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.</p>
        <p>20.2. Location. The arbitration will take place in Los Angeles, California, unless you opt for video, phone or internet connection appearances.</p>
        <p>20.3. Limitations. You and Denari agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Denariand you individually. YOU AND DENARI AGREE THAT (a) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (b) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (c) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.</p>
        <p>20.4. Exceptions to Arbitration. You and Denari agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of Denari intellectual property rights; (b) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>
        <p>20.5. Arbitration Fees. If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will need to pay the JAMS arbitration initiation fee. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules.</p>
        <p>20.6. Severability. You and Denari agree that if any portion of this Section 19 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 19.4), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 19.4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Denari will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 19.4 found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles, California, United States of America, and you and Denari agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

            NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION: OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA
            The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is available at the website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB): www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-referenced to the U.S. Code is at the end of this document.Section 623 imposes the following duties upon furnishers:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2>22. Accuracy Guidelines</h2>
        <p>The FCRA requires furnishers to comply with federal regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers. Federal regulations and guidelines are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. Section 623(e).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2>23. General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information</h2>
        <p>The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously specifies an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Section 623(a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(C).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2>24. Duty to Correct and Update Information</h2>
        <p>If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623(a)(2).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2>25. Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer</h2>
        <p>If a consumer notifies a furnisher, at an address specified by the furnisher for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623(a)(1)(B). If a consumer notifies a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623(a)(3). Furnishers must comply with federal regulations that identify when an information furnisher must investigate a dispute made directly to the furnisher by a consumer. Under these regulations, furnishers must complete an investigation within 30 days (or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a “credit repair organization.” Section 623(a)(8). Federal regulations are available at www.consumerfinance.gov. Section 623(a)(8).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2>26. Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer Reporting Agency</h2>
        <p>If a CRA notifies a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information provided by the furnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The furnisher must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct an investigation and review all relevant information provided by the CRA, including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Section 623(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B)</li>

Section 623(b)(1)(C) and (b)(1)(D).</li>
            <li> Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute (or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA). Section 623(b)(2).</li>
            <li> Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623(b)(1)(E).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2>27. Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts:</h2>
        <p> If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnished information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed.

    </div>

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2> 28. Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies:</h2>
        <p>If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer’s file. Section 623(a)(5)Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623(a)(5) (until there is a consumer dispute) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date cannot be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623(a)(5).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2> 29. Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information</h2>
        <p>Financial institutions that furnish information to “nationwide” consumer reporting agencies, as defined in Section 603(p), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA.

Section 623(a)(9). This notice will enable CRAs comply with their duties under Section 604(g) when reporting medical information.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pp-text">
        <h2>31. Duties When ID Theft Occurs</h2>
        <p> All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623(a)(6). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each CRA of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623(a)(2). When any furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances. Section 615(f).</p>
